0.15    -not released-
0.16    Fixed local file list when running under Windows (was trying to call
        ls which does not exist in Windows - we now emulate it, except can't 
        get user/group name.  I'm open to ideas on this.
0.17    Fixed bug that caused warning when ftp::ls() returns undef at lines 
        360, 396, 458, and 495.  Also optimized many regices w/ \o.
0.20    Added support for Net::SSH2 and made compatable with Windows.
0.21    Added "mdtm" function to return a file's modification time.  Also fixed 
        bug in the "size" function for SSH2 protocol.  Also fixed bug that 
        caused "ls" function to return hidden files reguardless of "showall" 
        parameter value.
0.3b1   Rewrote to modularize each supported protocol in it's own module file.
        Added support for protocols:  Net::SFTP::Foreign, Net::OpenSSH,
        and Net::FSP!
0.4     Added support for Net::FTPSSL protocol.
0.41    Fixed bugs that caused FTPSSL protocol to silently use FTP protocol 
        instead.  This addresses bug#58210.
0.42    Fix bug in xFTP_SSH2 that prevented "puts" (line 403 - chg put() 
        to scp_put() - caught by me.
0.43    Fix type bug in xFTP.pm affecting Net::SFTP::Foreign (had it as 
        "Net::SFTP2::Foreign at line 305.  Caught by Paul Findlay, Thanks, Paul!
        Also fixed formatting bug in the dir() function and added 
        login timeout handler (sig(alarm)) and new option "login_timeout" (sec) - 
        default is 30 seconds (caught by me).
0.44    Fix bug that prevented module-specific arguments from being passed 
        directly to the module.  Caught by Paul Findlay, Thanks again, Paul.
0.44b1	 Fix FTPSSL mkdir() to actually implement recursion, fix FTPSSL dir 
	  & ls functions to be specific to this module (FTPSSL uses different 
	  names for them and does not implement recursion in mkdir.  These 
	  address CPAN bug#63290. Thanks Kate Yoak for the catch & patch!
	  Incorporated minor change to Foreign and removed depreciated set_status 
	  call from FTP.
0.45    Incorporate 0.44b1 changes into an actual release.  This should address 
	  bugs 63290 & 68801.
